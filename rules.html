            <h3>Rules and Regulations of the NBA</h3>
            <ol>
                <h2><li>Regulation NBA Court</li></h2>
                <p>One of the most important NBA basketball rules is the length of the court. They have their own dimensions for a perfect court. You are required to follow these rules when constructing a court.The court must be 94 feet long and 50 feet wide.The line for three-pointers is 23 feet 9 inches. The free-throw line is equal to the distance from the basket but this lane is 16 feet wide</p> <a href="https://sportsierra.com/nba-official-basketball-rules-and-regulations/"> Click for more information on this Rule</a>
                
                <h2><li>Twenty-Four Second Shot Clock</li></h2>
                <p>Another regulation is the 24-second shot clock. As a team, if you possess the ball you have 24 seconds to attempt a shot.All the NBA games have four quarters that last for 12 minutes each.</p><a href="https://sportsierra.com/nba-official-basketball-rules-and-regulations/"> Click for more information on this Rule</a>
                
                <h2><li>Timeouts</li></h2>
                <p>Both teams must have a total of six 60-seconds timeouts in a game.The number of timeouts permitted is two. Every 20-second timeout lasts for every half game played</p><a href="https://sportsierra.com/nba-official-basketball-rules-and-regulations/"> Click for more information on this Rule</a>
                
                <h2><li>Fighting and Flagrant Fouls</li></h2>
                <p>Lastly, fighting from the bench is not allowed during an NBA game. From the general rules, you are not allowed to get off the bench into the field to help your teammates.This kind of behavior will lead to your suspension for the next game or even a fine. I bet you do not want to face any of these if you are a player. Therefore, observing this rule will save you that.Fragrant fouls are also dangerous. The two fouls occur when first, you make unnecessary contact with your opponent. For this, you will be adjourned from your following game or fined.Also, if you have extreme contact and this one is usually very serious. Here you will be ejected, suspended or fined.</p><a href="https://sportsierra.com/nba-official-basketball-rules-and-regulations/"> Click for more information on this Rule</a>
